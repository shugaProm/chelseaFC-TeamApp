# chelseaFC-TeamApp
nodejs | express app

My first NodeJs|Express app.

This is a simple app developed for my favorite football club @ chelsea FC.
We can add players to the database, thereby creating player profiles when they are signed and delete them also when
they are sold or out of contract.
We can also edit the player profile.

Tech used are Nodejs | Express | Mysql db | Express-handlebars
